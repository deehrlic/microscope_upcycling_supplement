# microscope_upcycling_supplement

This repositoty contains the supplemental material for the paper "Microscope Upcycling: Transforming legacy microscopes into automated cloud-integrated imaging systems" by Yohei Rosen, Drew Ehrlich, David F. Parks, Ryan Fenimore, David Haussler, Sri Kurniawan, and Mircea Teodorescu

To order machined parts (files in this repository with the extension .dxf), use any remote manufacturing service - we recommend SendCutSend. These parts should be manufactured out of 3mm thick 304 Series Stainless Steel or similar. The part bendpartv2.dxf needs to have a 90 degree right angle bend added to be used correctly.

Printed parts (files in this repository with the extension .dxf) should be ordered from a 3D printing or CNC milling service if you cannot manufacture them in house - we recommed PCBWay. Since the printed parts for this project are load-bearing, they should be printed out of a very strong material - we opted for Steel printed with Selective Laser Melting, but other stiff materials like ASA or Nylon will probably be sufficient.
